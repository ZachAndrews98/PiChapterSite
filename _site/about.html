<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>We the brothers of the Pi Chapter of Phi Gamma Delta, exist to create a group of extraordinary gentlemen through diversity, excellence, and love for oneself. We aim to seek the highest standard of Friendship through diverse lifelong bonds of brotherhood. We aim to achieve true Knowledge through scholarly excellence. We aim to be the standard of Service for fraternities and sororities on campus through our commitment to philanthropy and community service. We aim to be the definition of Morality for knowing right from wrong and treating others with the utmost respect and showing we are truly Fiji gentlemen. We aim to achieve Excellence by upholding these four values and will aim to always lead with love and compassion for oneself and for the world.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded on June 5th, 1860, the Pi Chapter of Phi Gamma Delta was the fourteenth
  chapter of Phi Gamma Delta to be founded. The chapter remained in operation
  until 1998, when the chapter was kicked off of Allegheny College's campus and
  the charter revoked by the International Headquarters of Phi Gamma Delta. The
  chapter then remained closed until 2013, when it was recharted. Since that point
  the chapter has strived to excel in everything it places its mind upon and to
  build the most upstanding fraternity men as possible.</p>

<h2>Values</h2>
<p>The Fraternity has five core values. <strong>Friendship</strong>,
  <strong>Knowledge</strong>, <strong>Service</strong>, <strong>Morality</strong>,
  and <strong>Excellence</strong>. These values are the pillars that have allowed
  for Phi Gamma Delta to remain in operation across the country and in Canada
  since 1848. These pillars are what every brother of the Pi Chapter are held to
  for any brother who is not held to the highest of standards cannot truly be a
  Fiji Gentleman nor a Couragous Leader.

# Headshot Guide

## Filename

The name of any and all headshots used for a brother should be <last name in lower case>.png. If it is not in this format then the automatic image locating scripts will not be able to properly locate the correct image.

## Size

The dimensions of the headshots should all be Height: 960px by Width: 779px. This will allow for all images on the page to be of a consistant size and keep uniformity.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded on June 5th, 1860, the Pi Chapter of Phi Gamma Delta was the fourteenth
  chapter of Phi Gamma Delta to be founded. The chapter remained in operation
  until 1998, when the chapter was kicked off of Allegheny College's campus and
  the charter revoked by the International Headquarters of Phi Gamma Delta. The
  chapter then remained closed until 2013, when it was recharted. Since that point
  the chapter has strived to excell in everything it places its mind upon and to
  build the most upstanding fraternity men as possible.</p>

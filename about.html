<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded on June 5th, 1860, the Pi Chapter of Phi Gamma Delta was the ninth
  chapter of Phi Gamma Delta to be founded. The chapter has had several notible
  brothers, like Brother Edwin Mattern class of 1890. The chapter remained in
  operation until 1998 when the chapter was kicked off of Allegheny College's
  campus and the charter revoked by the International Headquarters of Phi Gamma
  Delta. The chapter then remained closed until 2013, when it was recharted.
  Since that point the chapter has strived to excel in everything it places its
  mind upon and to build the most upstanding fraternity men as possible.</p>

<h2>Values</h2>
<p>The Fraternity has five core values. <strong>Friendship</strong>,
  <strong>Knowledge</strong>, <strong>Service</strong>, <strong>Morality</strong>,
  and <strong>Excellence</strong>. These values are the pillars that have allowed
  for Phi Gamma Delta to remain in operation across the country and in Canada
  since 1848. These pillars are what every brother of the Pi Chapter are held to
  for any brother who is not held to the highest of standards cannot truly be a
  Fiji Gentleman nor a Couragous Leader.
